Local Repositpry -> Fetch will get the files from remote repository; push will put files in remote repositoty.

Index cache -> add from working direcoty will create a snapshot; commit will put this to local repository
Index cache is also known as staging area....

Working Directory -> Pull will get the files from remote repository; Checkout head -> Get file from Local Repository

to create a local git repository:
